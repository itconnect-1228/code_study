"""Services package for business logic layer.

This package contains service classes that encapsulate business logic
and coordinate between API endpoints and data models.

Service Layer Benefits:
- Separation of concerns: Business logic is isolated from HTTP handling
- Testability: Services can be tested independently
- Reusability: Same service can be used by multiple endpoints
